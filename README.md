The Heart Disease dataset contains various medical details about patients that can help predict whether they have heart disease or not. The age column represents the patient’s age in years, and the sex column indicates the patient’s gender, where 1 is male and 0 is female. The cp column shows the type of chest pain the patient experiences, such as typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or no pain at all. The trestbps column records the patient’s resting blood pressure, while chol represents their cholesterol level. The fbs column tells us if the patient's fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl. The restecg column shows the results of the patient’s resting electrocardiogram, which measures heart activity. The thalch column shows the maximum heart rate the patient reached during exercise, and exang indicates whether the patient had chest pain during exercise. The oldpeak column measures the depression of the ST segment in the electrocardiogram caused by exercise, while the slope column shows the slope of the ST segment during peak exercise. The ca column tells us how many major blood vessels were visible during a fluoroscopy exam, and thal refers to a blood disorder called thalassemia, with three possible conditions. The num column is the target variable, which tells us if the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0). This target column depends on the other columns, making this dataset a supervised learning dataset. The goal is to use the information from the other columns to predict whether a patient has heart disease. This is a categorical supervised dataset, as the target variable ("num") consists of distinct categories.
